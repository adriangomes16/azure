# Log Analytics

Log Analytics is the data store for all sorts of log collection in Azure. Application Insights sends data to Log Analytics, and it can also be used directly for Virtual Machines, and to ingest logs saved in Storage Accounts.

The Azure Portal has a rich UI in Log Analytics for querying data, using Kusto Query Language (KQL). You can use KQL with Log Analytics data for other monitoring tools (to power dashboards and alerts), and you use Log Analytics to write and test the queries for them - as well as for interactive querying.

In this lab we'll see how Log Analytics gives access to data collected by Application Insights, and get some experience with KQL.

## Generate some log data

**If you have done the [Application Insights lab](/labs/applicationinsights/README.md) and still have your `labs-appinsights` Resource Group with App Insights and Log Analytics then you can skip this step.**

<details>
  <summary>Create the Log Analytics Workspace and run some containers to generate logs</summary>

Create one RG for monitoring, with Workspace and App Insights:

```
az group create -n labs-appinsights -l eastus --tags courselabs=azure

az monitor log-analytics workspace create -g labs-appinsights -n labsloganalytics -l eastus

az monitor app-insights component create --app labs --kind web -g labs-appinsights --workspace labsloganalytics -l eastus
```

Get the connection string for App Insights:

```
az monitor app-insights component show --app labs -g labs-appinsights --query connectionString -o tsv
```

Create another RG for sample apps, with ACI containers writing to App Insights:

```
az group create -n labs-appinsights-apps --tags courselabs=azure -l eastus

az container create -g labs-appinsights-apps  --image courselabs/fulfilment-processor:appinsights-1.0 --no-wait --name fp1 --secure-environment-variables "ApplicationInsights__ConnectionString=<appinsights-connection-string>"

az container create -g labs-appinsights-apps  --image courselabs/fulfilment-processor:appinsights-1.0 --no-wait --name fp2 --secure-environment-variables "ApplicationInsights__ConnectionString=<appinsights-connection-string>"

az container create -g labs-appinsights-apps  --image courselabs/fulfilment-processor:appinsights-1.0 --no-wait --name fp3 --secure-environment-variables "ApplicationInsights__ConnectionString=<appinsights-connection-string>"

az container create -g labs-appinsights-apps  --image courselabs/fulfilment-processor:appinsights-1.2 --no-wait --name fp4 --secure-environment-variables "ApplicationInsights__ConnectionString=<appinsights-connection-string>"
```

</details><br />

The ACI containers generate a lot of logs and metrics, so you should have plenty of data to work with.

## Query Application Logs

Open your Log Analytics Workspace in the Portal, and browse to the _Logs_ view. You'll see a pop-up with lots of sample queries, none of which are any use here so you can close that window.

Now you're in the KQL query editor. The left menu has a list of sample queries which are also no use here, so switch to the _Tables_ view:

![Log Analytics tables](/img/loganalytics-query-editor.png)

These are the actual data tables in the Workspace. Expand _LogManagement_ and you'll see lots of tables which are populated from Application Insights.

The simplest KQL query is just the table name. Try selecting data from these tables:

- AppEvents
- AppDependencies
- AppTraces

This is the same data you see surfaced in different views in Application Insights. `AppTraces` contains the actual log entries written by the application.

Explore some more KQL queries - it's similar to SQL but it has many more functions and a stricter syntax. Individual queries can't have a line break in them, and clauses are separated with a pipe (`|`):

```
AppTraces
| limit 100

AppMetrics
| order by TimeGenerated desc 
| limit 10

AppTraces
| distinct SeverityLevel

AppTraces
| summarize LogsBySeverity = count() by(SeverityLevel)
```

What are we seeing here? The first 100 log entries; the 10 most recent log entries; the list of log severities across all logs; a breakdown showing the count for each log severity. Do you have any severity 3 logs? 

ðŸ“‹ Write a KQL to find the individual log entries for a specific severity level - print just the message, application name and instance name for each entry.

ðŸ“‹ How many logs of severity 3 have the error code 302?

ðŸ“‹ Can you see if one application instance is recording more `Fulfilment.Failed` events than the others?

## Aggregating Application Metrics

Everything from App Insights is recorded as a row in a table, which means you use the same query language to drill into individual log entries and to summarize metrics.

The `AppMetrics` table stores custom metrics get reported by applications. Try these queries:

```
AppMetrics
| count

AppMetrics
| limit 10

AppMetrics
| where (Name == "QueueSize")
| summarize AvgQueueLength = avg(Sum)
```

What was all that? The count of all recorded metrics; the first 10 rows of metrics; the average of the `QueueSize` metric.

That average isn't much use because it's the average over all time. More useful would be a breakdown of the average queue length over time, so we can see if it's trending up or down and if there are outliers.

ðŸ“‹ What does the average queue size look like if you summarize it by 10 minute intervals?

ðŸ“‹ Can you render that table with a more useful visualization?

## Lab

Visualizations in Log Analytics are good for quick queries, but if you want a more useful view of application health and performance you need to create a Workbook. The Workbook UX in Azure takes some getting used to, but the visualizations are powered by KQL queries over a Log Analytics Workspace.

Build a Workbook for the Fulfilment Processor app which shows:

- a table of all the instances which are currently running
- a breakdown of the `Fulfilment.Failed` events, split by instance
- a graph of `QueueSize`, averaged across 10-minute intervals

## Cleanup

Delete the RG(s) and all the data will be deleted too:

```
az group delete -y --no-wait -n labs-appinsights-apps

az group delete -y --no-wait -n labs-appinsights
```
